              Every year there is a Perl Conference in Europe. It has gone by
              many names, originally being called YAPC (Yet Another Perl
              Conference), a tongue in cheek naming which was more recently
              changed to more clearly represent that this conference is the
              largest and premier Perl conference in Europe.  The Perl &amp;
              Raku Conference - formerly known as YAPC::EU and PerlCon - is the
              yearly meeting of Perl Mongers in Europe.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              Due to the Perl 6 programming language renaming to Raku, this year
              the name has been changed to The Perl and Raku Conference or
              PerlRakuCon for short (PerlCon or RakuCon are also acceptable).
